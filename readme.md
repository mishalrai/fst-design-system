## Design System

The project specially design for create and test isolate component and make ready to intergrate in any project. In this way we can reduce the development and project and need less learning curve to create any component and it's easy to maintian also.

We already developed this kind of [design system](https://github.com/mishalrai/design-system) in my personal github repo which is also public. But i would also like to make in node.

## Reference
For this project i am checking node documentation from [expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) also taking reference from the old design system project.
